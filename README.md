## 📊 Project Overview
This Business Intelligence project moves beyond "Vanity Metrics" (Sales) to focus on "Business Health" (Profit). Using the Global Superstore dataset, I built an interactive dashboard to identify **"Profit Killers"**—products that drive high revenue but result in net losses.

## 🔍 Key Insights
* **The "Texas Problem":** Identified that while Texas is a Top-3 state for Sales volume, it is the #1 worst performer for Profit (-$25k), driven by aggressive discounting.
* **Product Analysis:** The scatter plot reveals that "3D Systems Cube Printers" are sold at a negative margin across 4 regions.
* **Strategic Recommendation:** Stop discounting on low-margin technology products in the Central Region to recover 15% of lost profit.
